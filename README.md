Setting up the Backend server(Nodejs)
	*Note:- You can setup your own backend server as you just have to server the required printing libs and 			files to the client.
	
	1. Considering Nodejs and Express are installed on the machine, run this cmd
		express project_name
		cd project_name
		npm install
		npm start - just to check all is set by putting the http://localhost:3000 in firefox.
	2. Here comes the actual flow:-
		A. Put all files in the public folder
			These file can be found under the extracted jzebra folder. 
				jzebra_extracted_folder/qz-print/dist/qz-print.jar
				jzebra_extracted_folder/qz-print/dist/qz-print_jnlp.jnlp
				jzebra_extracted_folder/qz-print/dist/js/*
		For Example:-
			app
				-public
					..
					javascripts
						---jzebra_extracted_folder/qz-print/dist/js/*
					qz-print.jar
					qz-print_jnlp.jnlp
				-views
					.html file which contains the print logic.(here print.html)
					print.html is sample.html found here
						jzebra_extracted_folder/qz-print/dist/sample.html
	3. Then in main file of server ex:- app.js or server.js make the changes to serve 		the 				print.html page.

	4. Then going to http://localhost:3000/ the firefox should ask for the blocked content permission. Allow 			the blocked content then you should get the error or nothing should go for the print on 			clicking any print button.

	5. Now open the java control panel and go to security tab. At the bottom you will get Edit List button to 			Exception Sites block.

	6. Here Add the such page links whcih executes the applet code. 
		In this Example
			http://localhost:3000
			http://localhost:3000/qz-printer(optional, it the error continues)
		Also check for the security level. Set Medium or High
	7. Save the above settings.
	
	8. Restart the firefox browser and re-run the url. This should work now which will prompt for the security 		block asking the permission to run the applet.
